Aiven homework
==============

This is a coding assignment for a Java developer position at Aiven.

The exercise should be relatively fast to complete. You can spend as much time
as you want to. If all this is very routine stuff for you, this should not
take more than a few hours. If there are many new things, a few evenings should
already be enough time.

We select the candidates for the interview based on the homework, so pay
attention that your solution demonstrates your skills in developing production
quality code.

If you run out of time, please return a partial solution, and describe in your
reply how you would continue having more time.

Please use Java for the exercise. We would ask you to avoid using
the Spring Framework and any code generations tools such as Lombok. Otherwise,
you have the freedom to select suitable tools and libraries.

Be prepared to defend your solution in the possible interview later.

To return your homework, store the code and related documentation on GitHub
for easy access. Please send following information via email:

- link to the GitHub repository
- if you ran out of time and you are returning a partial solution, description
  of what is missing and how you would continue

Your code will only be used for the evaluation.

Exercise
========

Your task is to implement a system that generates operating system metrics and
passes the events through Aiven Kafka instance to Aiven PostgreSQL database.
For this, you need a Kafka producer which sends data to a Kafka topic, and a
Kafka consumer storing the data to Aiven PostgreSQL database. For practical
reasons, these components may run in the same machine (or container or whatever
system you choose), but in production use similar components would run in
different systems.

You can choose what metric or metrics you collect and send. You can implement
metrics collection by yourself or use any available tools or libraries.

Even though this is a small concept program, returned homework should include
tests and proper packaging. If your tests require Kafka and PostgreSQL
services, for simplicity your tests can assume those are already running,
instead of integrating Aiven service creation and deleting.

Aiven is a Database as a Service vendor and the homework requires using our
services. Please register to Aiven at https://console.aiven.io/signup.html at
which point you'll automatically be given $300 worth of credits to play around
with. The credits should be enough for a few hours of use of our services. If
you need more credits to complete your homework, please contact us.

Criteria for evaluation
=======================

- Code formatting and clarity. We value readable code written for other
  developers, not for a tutorial, or as one-off hack.
- We appreciate demonstrating your experience and knowledge, but also utilizing
  existing libraries. There is no need to re-invent the wheel.
- Practicality of testing. 100% test coverage may not be practical, and also
  having 100% coverage but no validation is not very useful.
- Automation. We like having things work automatically, instead of multi-step
  instructions to run misc commands to set up things. Similarly, CI is a
  relevant thing for automation.
- Attribution. If you take code from Google results, examples etc., add
  attributions. We all know new things are often written based on search results.
- "Open source ready" repository. It's very often a good idea to pretend the
  homework assignment in Github is used by random people (in practice, if you
  want to, you can delete/hide the repository as soon as we have seen it).
